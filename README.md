# Photo Journal Assistant

The **Photo Journal Assistant** is a Streamlit-based app that helps you transform your daily experiences into personalized journal entries using photos. Upload your images, and the app will generate captions, extract metadata, and craft a cohesive and reflective journal entry. 

---

## Features

### 1. **Image Caption Generation**
   - Uses the **BLIP Image Captioning** model from Salesforce to generate meaningful captions for uploaded images.
   - Captions are tailored based on a given prompt, such as describing the image's essence or context.

### 2. **Metadata Extraction**
   - Extracts EXIF metadata from images, such as:
     - **Date Taken**: The timestamp when the photo was captured.
     - **Location**: Latitude and longitude if GPS data is available.
   - Displays human-readable formats for easy understanding.

### 3. **Journal Entry Generation**
   - Combines image captions and metadata to create a reflective, personalized journal entry.
   - Powered by **Google Gemini AI**, it crafts immersive and engaging narratives using a creative writing prompt.

### 4. **Downloadable Output**
   - Outputs the journal entry in plain text format.
   - Users can download and save their generated journals.

### 5. **Live Preview**
   - Try the app live: [Photo Journal Assistant (Live)](https://vinay-pepakayala-ai-photo-journel-assistant.hf.space)
